I'm Jiyoung Hwang, a self-taught web developer and organizer of [Django Girls Seoul](https://www.facebook.com/djangogirlsseoul/). I love to create playful UI, learn new tools and frameworks and share through my blog and workshops.

I believe in the power of diversity in tech and the power of technology to make the world flatter and more connected.
