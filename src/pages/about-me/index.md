Self-taught, web developer as well as an organizer at [Django Girls Seoul](https://www.facebook.com/djangogirlsseoul/). I love creating beautiful websites and learning new tools and frameworks.

I believe in the power of diversity in tech and the power of technology to make the world flatter and more connected.
